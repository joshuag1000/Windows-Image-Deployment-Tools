# Windows Image Deployment Tools
These tools are to be used to capture and modify a Windows Image for deployment to various computers. <br>
There is 2 versions of these tools. A new GUI based set of tools which (will) offer the same functions as the original legacy scripts as well as some new features like adding drivers in the winpe environment.
The Legacy scrips still exist but are in maintenance mode meaning they will recieve no new features.
