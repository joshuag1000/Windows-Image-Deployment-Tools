These tools are to be used to capture and modify a Windows Image for deployment to various computers.
There are 2 main tools in the repository.
    ImageModification - This can be used to inject device drivers and languages into an image
    WinPE - This is used to create a WinPE drive that can be used to capture or deploy and image to a computer. Because this uses a standard WinPE environment with some startup scripts to give the options to deploy or capture an image.

More Documentation to come soon.
